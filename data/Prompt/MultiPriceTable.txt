I am a financial analyst working with a range of financial tables and stock prices. I need your assistance in summarizing the key insights from these sources and addressing the most pressing questions investors might have.

#Goal
To create a summary of the key insights from the financial tables provided.
To generate two more questions as possible based on the #QuestionGuidance provided.
To calculate some relevant ratios or indicators if necessary based on the data in #Input.
To answer the questions based on the provided data and what your calculation, #AnswerGuidance and #Hints.
To support your answer with some sources of the data in #Input.
To provide a well-formatted JSON-formatted answer without breaking #Restrictions.

#Restrictions
Do not include information where the #Input for it is not provided.
Return just a JSON-formatted answer, without any additional information.
No need to include any additional information in the #Return including the string "#Return", "#Answer", "# OUTPUT" and so on.
To make sure the #Return is well-formed JSON
To make sure the #Return begins with "{" and ends with "}"
All the sources in #Return must be the same as the data in #Input. Create a new source(e.g. a new indicator_name) is not allowed.
All the questions in #Return must have answers.
All the number rounding should be done to two decimal places.

#QuestionGuidance
1. Understand the Question Schema in #INPUT
2. The thing in "[]"(e.g. [Company]/[Indicator]/[date]) means the name of the company/ticker symbol/date/quarter/year/indicator/unit.
3. The thing in "{}"(e.g. {value}/{percentage}/{trend}) means the value/percentage/trend of the indicator.
4. There are some parameters like "[X]","[Y]","[Z]","[Q]", "[P]", etc. in the #INPUT. Please replace them with the actual values.
5. Please replace all the the thing in "[]" and "{}" based on the data in #INPUT
6. Make sure all the assumptions(like the number of the outstanding shares, only "Given the outstanding shares" is not allowed, "Given the outstanding shares is 10000000" is correct) in the Question Schema is contained the Question you generated.
7. Rewrite the question with your own words but must not change the meaning of the question.
8. Please note the Interval, if the Interval is "Quarter" and the date is "2022-03-31", then the quarter is "Q1 2022". So you can use "Q1 2022" instead of "2022-03-31" in the question. If the Interval is "Year", then the date is "2022-12-31", you can use "2022 Year Report" instead of "2022-12-31" in the question.

#AnswerGuidance
1. Understand the Guidelines in #INPUT
2. Read the #Hints carefully and find out the type of question in #INPUT.
3. Read the #Example carefully and understanding how to provide the answer and step-by-step explanation.
4. The answer is summarized from the step-by-step explanation, usually the final result of the calculation.
5. Follow the guidelines and your understanding of #Hints to answer the question step by step.
6. Show all the steps you have taken to answer the question.

#Example
##Example 1: 
Question: Has the Amazon com Inc's nonInterestIncome trend kept pace with Netflix Inc's nonInterestIncome growth from 2022Q2 to 2022Q4?
Answer: No
Explanation: 
- Step1: Explanation(The nonInterestIncome of Amazon com Inc in 2022Q2 was 1.25 billion USD, the nonInterestIncome of Amazon com Inc in 2022Q4 was 1.35 billion USD. It increased 0.10 billion USD), equation(1.35-1.25=0.10)
